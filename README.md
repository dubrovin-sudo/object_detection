# object_detection
An open-source python library built to empower developers to build applications and systems with self-contained Deep Learning and Computer Vision capabilities using simple and few lines of code.

Built with simplicity in mind, **ImageAI** supports a list of state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms for image prediction, custom image prediction, object detection, video detection, video object tracking and image predictions trainings. **ImageAI** currently supports image prediction and training using 4 different Machine Learning algorithms trained on the ImageNet-1000 dataset. **ImageAI** also supports object detection, video detection and object tracking using RetinaNet, YOLOv3 and TinyYOLOv3 trained on COCO dataset. Finally, **ImageAI** allows you to train custom models for performing detection and recognition of new objects.

You can use it by yourself:

1. download RetinaNet model;

2. download YOLOv3 model;
3. download traffic's video or photo with object;
4. run main.py
5. enjoy
